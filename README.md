# Rick React Next

This is a [React](https://reactjs.org) app to visualize characters from Rick & Morty TV show. The data will be obtained from the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com).

The project was bootstrapped with [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org), a static generator framework, for easy deployment on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and [Now](https://zeit.co/now), as a serverless lambda function.

The initial requirements very simple:
* display the characters with pagination;
* be able to filter by status, species and gender;
* be able to search a character by name;
* be able to sort the cards by name (ascendant and descandant).
